                    <h1>My new Journey as a bootcamp student. </h1>
                    <p>
                        I'm excited to start a new learning journey 
                        as a Scrimba Bootcamp student! After several 
                        months of learning in the Frontend Developer 
                        Career Path.

                        <h2>How I stay committed to learning</h2>

                        <p>I like to think of myself as a lifelong 
                            learner. I used to spend hours and hours 
                            learning, then try to create simple projects 
                            using what I learned or work new techniques 
                            into existing projects.</p>
                        <p>
                            While that was fun, I felt like it would 
                            be helpful to share what I was learning 
                            and most things about my journey with the world.

                        <h2>How I got started</h2>

                        <p>
                            I started simple and gradually grew my 
                            learning journal site. I would take notes 
                            about what I was learning. After each learning 
                            session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on 
                            what I learned but also write short summaries of 
                            what I learned using my own words.</p>
                        <p>
                            That helped me grok what I was learning, 
                            and I realized that posting my learning 
                            summaries was also helping others learn 
                            and stay motivated.
